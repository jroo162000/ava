# AVA Integration Progress Log

<!--
PURPOSE: Session-by-session log of changes, tests, and next steps.
RULES FOR CLAUDE:
- Append new sessions at the top (newest first).
- Each entry: date, what changed, what test proved it, what's next.
- Reference DECISIONS.md for architectural choices.
- Reference ava_feature_list.json for pass/fail status.

================================================================================
2026-02-02 - Node Tool Execution Boundary Enforced
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- Refactored ava_standalone_realtime.py handle_tool_call() to use Node boundary
- Refactored ava_bridge.py /tool endpoint to proxy to Node /tools/:name/execute
- Added execute_tool() method to ava_server_client.py
- Removed direct cmpuse Agent tool execution from Python
- Created TOOL_BOUNDARY_ARCHITECTURE.md documenting the pattern

ARCHITECTURE:
- Python components are now INTENT PRODUCERS only (text + metadata)
- Node boundary is the SINGLE EXECUTION GATEWAY
- Idempotency check happens at Node boundary (already implemented)
- Python worker provides tool runtime but only called by Node after validation

WHAT TEST PROVED IT:
- Smoke test: 4/4 PASS (unchanged)
- Repo scan: no alternate tool-dispatch paths in production code
- All tool execution flows through Node /tools/:name/execute

WHAT'S NEXT:
- Smoke test green - steady progress mode
- Continue with remaining features:
  - final_only_transcript_gating (phase_2_stability)

================================================================================
2026-02-02 - Repo Curation: Archive Duplicate Runners
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- Created ava-integration/archive/ folder
- Archived non-canonical runners:
  - ava_standalone.py
  - ava_hybrid_asr.py
  - avas_voice.py
  - avas_voice_websockets.py
  - voice_legacy/ backups
- Updated start_ava.ps1 to start only:
  - Node server (port 5051)
  - Canonical runner (ava_standalone_realtime.py)
- Added archive/README.md documenting why files were archived
- Created ARCHIVAL_REPORT_2026-02-02.md

WHAT TEST PROVED IT:
- Smoke test: 4/4 PASS (unchanged)
- Verified no startup script references archived runners
- Single banner prints on startup identifying canonical runner

WHAT'S NEXT:
- Smoke test green - steady progress mode
- Continue with remaining features:
  - final_only_transcript_gating (phase_2_stability)
  - node_gateway_boundary (phase_3_tool_execution)

================================================================================
2026-02-02 - Idempotency Cache Implemented
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- Added IdempotencyCache class to ava-server/src/services/tools.js
- Modified executeTool() to check cache before execution
- Added /tools/idempotency/stats and /tools/idempotency/clear endpoints
- Created 26 unit tests in ava-server/tests/idempotency.test.js
- Updated smoke_test.py to detect Node boundary idempotency

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Key = SHA-256(normalized tool_name + args)
- TTL: 60 seconds (configurable)
- Normalization: sort keys, trim whitespace, lowercase, remove volatile fields
- Blocked message: "I already did that recently. Do you want me to do it again?"
- Log reason: idempotency_blocked

WHAT TEST PROVED IT:
- Unit tests: 26/26 passed
- Smoke test: 4/4 passed (idempotency now PASS)
- Tested: same tool+args within TTL blocked, after TTL allowed

WHAT'S NEXT:
- Smoke test passes - unblocked
- Continue with remaining features:
  - final_only_transcript_gating (phase_2_stability)
  - node_gateway_boundary (phase_3_tool_execution)

================================================================================
2026-02-02 - Canonical Smoke Test Created
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- Created scripts/smoke_test.py in ava-integration
- Smoke test checks 4 invariants:
  1. Single runner (no duplicates)
  2. Final-only transcript gating
  3. Idempotency cache
  4. No loop indicators (config valid)

WHAT TEST PROVED IT:
- Ran smoke test: 3/4 passed
- FAIL: Idempotency cache not implemented

WHAT'S NEXT:
- BLOCKED: Smoke test fails on idempotency
- Must implement idempotency cache before any other work
- Cannot proceed until smoke test passes

================================================================================
2026-02-02 - Integration Lead Artifacts Setup
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- Created agent/ folder with governance artifacts
- Documented 9 architectural decisions in DECISIONS.md
- Established feature checklist in ava_feature_list.json
- Set runtime state in ava_state.json

WHAT TEST PROVED IT:
- Files committed to GitHub repo
- Structure follows Integration Lead contract

WHAT'S NEXT:
- Implement final_only_transcript_gating (voice-stabilizer agent)
- Enforce node_gateway_boundary (tool-gate-engineer agent)
- Add regression tests (qa-regression-agent)

================================================================================
2026-02-02 - Voice Stability Fixes (Prior Session)
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- Fixed segfaults by aligning sample rate to 22050 Hz throughout
- Added TTS serialization in session.py speak() method
- Implemented queue draining on tts.start and tts.end events
- Created voice_watchdog.py for crash recovery
- Lowered VAD threshold from 1200 to 300

WHAT TEST PROVED IT:
- Voice client runs longer without crashes
- Watchdog restarts automatically on segfault (exit code 139)
- Mic RMS values (~100-300) now exceed threshold
- No more queue overflow (was q=200/20, now stable at q=0/20)

WHAT'S NEXT:
- Set up Integration Lead artifacts (DONE)
- Implement remaining stability features

================================================================================
KNOWN ISSUES
================================================================================
1. Native PyAudio/PortAudio segfaults still occur occasionally
   - Mitigated by watchdog auto-restart
   - Root cause: threading issues in native libraries

2. final_only_transcript_gating not implemented
   - Partials can still trigger actions
   - Assigned to voice-stabilizer agent

3. Tool execution boundary not enforced
   - Python may execute tools directly
   - Assigned to tool-gate-engineer agent
