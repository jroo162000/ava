Version note - Stable baseline
Date: 2025-12-17

Summary:
- Deepgram Agent voice path integrated (mic → Agent ASR, audio out → PCM) with symbol-safe local TTS routing to server brain.
- Auto-start and health-check for ava-server (hot runner + standalone fallback).
- Half-duplex echo gating during TTS; barge-in with debounce and dynamic thresholds.
- Hot-reload for config and identity; hot-runner auto-restarts on code changes.

If rollback is needed, reference this snapshot date.
