# ALWAYS-ON AVA - Voice Assistant Setup

**AVA can now run in the background 24/7, listening for your voice commands!**

---

## 🚀 QUICK START

### Option 1: Run Once (Temporary)

**Double-click:**
```
start_ava_background.bat
```

This starts AVA in the background. Say **"AVA"** or **"Hey AVA"** to activate!

---

### Option 2: Auto-Start with Windows (Recommended)

**Double-click:**
```
install_ava_startup.bat
```

This makes AVA start automatically when you login to Windows!

After installation:
1. ✅ AVA will start automatically on every Windows login
2. 🔍 Look for the green circle icon in your system tray
3. 🎤 Say "AVA" anytime to activate

---

## 🎤 HOW TO USE

Just say: **"AVA"** or **"Hey AVA"**

### Example Commands:
```
"AVA, what time is it?"
"AVA, what's my system health?"

"AVA, read my emails"
"AVA, what's on my calendar today?"
"AVA, take a screenshot"
"AVA, check for security threats"
```

### Stop Listening:
- Right-click the system tray icon → "Stop Listening"
- Or say: "AVA, stop listening"

---

## 🎯 THREE MODES OF OPERATION

**Start with:**
```batch
pythonw ava_tray.pyw
```

### 2. **Console Mode**

## 📊 SYSTEM TRAY ICON MEANINGS

🟢 **Green Circle** = AVA is listening
🔴 **Red Circle** = AVA stopped
⚪ **Gray Circle** = AVA ready (not listening yet)

---

## 🎛️ SYSTEM TRAY CONTROLS

**Right-click the tray icon:**
- **Start Listening** - Begin voice recognition
- **Stop Listening** - Pause voice recognition
- **Open Web Interface** - Launch browser UI
- **Quit** - Exit AVA completely

---

## 🔧 CONFIGURATION

### Wake Word
Default: **"AVA"** or **"Hey AVA"**

To change, edit `ava_standalone.py` or `ava_tray.pyw`:
```python
wake_word="jarvis"  # Change to any word you want
```

### Voice Settings
AVA uses your system's default microphone and speakers.

**To change:**
- Windows Settings → System → Sound
- Set your preferred microphone as default

---

## 🚀 STARTUP OPTIONS

### Method 1: Windows Startup Folder (Automatic)
Run `install_ava_startup.bat` - done!

### Method 2: Task Scheduler (Advanced)
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Task: "AVA Assistant"
3. Trigger: At logon
4. Action: `pythonw.exe "C:\Users\USER 1\ava-integration\ava_tray.pyw"`

### Method 3: Registry Run Key (Advanced)
Add to: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
```
Name: AVA
Value: pythonw.exe "C:\Users\USER 1\ava-integration\ava_tray.pyw"
```

---

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### "AVA doesn't hear me"
- ✅ Check microphone permissions
- ✅ Ensure microphone is set as default
- ✅ Speak clearly and say "AVA" first
- ✅ Check console for errors

### "No system tray icon"
- Install dependencies: `pip install pystray pillow`
- Or use console mode: `python ava_standalone.py`

### "AVA won't start on login"
- Re-run `install_ava_startup.bat`
- Check: `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
- Look for "AVA Assistant.lnk"

### "Can't find pythonw"
- Python is installed but pythonw might be missing
- Use regular Python: Edit batch file to use `python.exe` instead
