2026-02-07 - Priorities 2-4: Piper routing, echo suppression, latency
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- P2: _speak_text() detects unified mode and routes through _voice_session.speak()
      (Piper/Edge local) instead of Deepgram remote API. Fixes 400 error spam.
      Startup log confirms TTS engine selection.
- P3: Unified bus handler now sets/clears runner tts_active on tts.start/tts.end.
      ASR partials dropped during TTS and 10s grace period. Echo gate covers
      both finals (in _on_final_user_text) and partials (in bus handler).
- P4: Consolidated [latency] line emitted at tts.end: asr=Nms llm=Nms
      tts_synth=Nms playback=Nms total=Nms. Uses existing timestamps.

TESTS ADDED:
- Test 10: 8 checks — unified TTS routing (Piper-only, no Deepgram remote)
- Test 11: 8 checks — echo suppression (tts_active + partial gating)
- Test 12: 10 checks — latency instrumentation (consolidated line)
- Total: 119/119 voice smoke, 18/18 base smoke

SUBAGENT DELEGATION:
- Direct (Integration Lead): P2, P3, P4 — all targeted single-file changes

================================================================================
2026-02-07 - Voice Fidelity Hardening (Steps A-E)
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- A1: DISABLE_AUTONOMY guards on all 3 Node schedulers (defense-in-depth)
- A2: Fixed 2 agent-mode _speak_text calls (silent no-op → proper async dispatch)
- B1: Deleted _get_natural_response() from Python (55 lines of canned text poison)
- B2: sha1 fidelity logging at /respond output + TTS input (proves no hidden rewrites)
- B3: try/finally on all SPEAK→force_idle paths (no leaked state)
- C1: Deleted getNaturalResponse() from Node api.js; run_tools honored (stepLimit=1,
      runTools=false); tool execution guard in act() skips tools when disabled
- D1: 17-check TTS fidelity smoke test (Test 9) catches "hardcoded voice" regression

SUBAGENT DELEGATION:
- tool-gate-engineer: A1 (scheduler guards), C1 (getNaturalResponse + run_tools)
- voice-stabilizer: A2 (speak call fix)
- Direct (Integration Lead): B1, B2, B3, D1

FILES MODIFIED:
- ava_standalone_realtime.py: B1 (remove _get_natural_response), B2 (sha1 logging),
  B3 (try/finally), A2 (agent mode async dispatch)
- scripts/voice_smoke_test.py: D1 (Test 9: 17 fidelity checks, total now 93)
- ava-server/src/server.js: A1 (DISABLE_AUTONOMY if/else wrapping all schedulers)
- ava-server/src/services/digestScheduler.js: A1 (callee guard)
- ava-server/src/services/doctor.js: A1 (callee guard)
- ava-server/src/routes/api.js: C1 (delete getNaturalResponse, honor run_tools)
- ava-server/src/services/agentLoop.js: C1 (runTools state, act() guard)

TESTS:
- 18/18 smoke, 93/93 voice smoke, 48/48 pytest

GIT: committed 7b9c99a, pushed to voice-stability-hardening

================================================================================
2026-02-06 - Merge-Blocker Pytest Tests (Scheduler + Wake-Only)
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- Added TestSchedulerDisabledInVoiceMode (5 pytest tests):
  - test_scheduler_exits_early_on_disable_autonomy
  - test_scheduler_no_full_autonomy_after_guard
  - test_scheduler_forbidden_strings_unreachable
  - test_heartbeat_exits_early_on_disable_autonomy
  - test_runner_sets_disable_autonomy
- Added TestWakeOnlyNoAgentLoop (14 pytest tests):
  - 8 parametrized wake-only ack tests (ava, ha ava, hey ava, etc.)
  - 4 parametrized command-reaches-agent tests
  - test_wake_only_gate_exists_in_source
  - test_no_agent_loop_for_bare_wake_word (end-to-end routing proof)

FILES MODIFIED:
- tests/test_voice_invariants.py: +207 lines, two new test classes

TESTS:
- 48/48 pytest (29 existing + 19 new)
- 18/18 smoke test
- 76/76 voice smoke test

GIT: committed 1e97bed, pushed to voice-stability-hardening

================================================================================
2026-02-06 - Memory Filter: Validation Mode Restricts to Facts Only
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- Python _ask_server_respond(): sends memory_filter="facts_only" when _validation_mode is True
  - /respond path: payload includes memory_filter for agentLoop
  - /chat path: also sets includeMemory=False to disable memory entirely
- Node agentLoop.js: createAgentState() stores memoryFilter from options
  - observe(): when memoryFilter==='facts_only', restricts retrieveRelevant types to
    [FACT, PREFERENCE, CONSTRAINT] only — excludes WORKFLOW, WARNING, AGENT_ACTION
  - Logs: [agent] Memory filter: facts_only (validation mode)
- Node api.js: both /respond routes extract memory_filter from request body
  and pass as memoryFilter to runAgentLoop options

FILES MODIFIED:
- ava_standalone_realtime.py: _ask_server_respond() payload + validation_mode gate
- ava-server/src/services/agentLoop.js: createAgentState, observe() memory type filter
- ava-server/src/routes/api.js: both /respond routes forward memory_filter
- scripts/voice_smoke_test.py: Test 8 (7 checks)

WHAT TEST PROVED IT:
- Smoke test: 18/18 PASS
- Voice smoke test: 76/76 PASS (was 69, +7 new Test 8 checks)
  - Python sends memory_filter='facts_only' in validation mode
  - Python gates on _validation_mode
  - agentLoop stores memoryFilter in state
  - agentLoop restricts types on facts_only
  - agentLoop excludes WORKFLOW
  - /respond route extracts memory_filter

ACCEPTANCE:
- Memory retrieval for "ha ava" returns 0 workflows/warnings/agent_actions
- Only FACT, PREFERENCE, CONSTRAINT memories allowed in validation mode
- Normal mode (VALIDATION_MODE=0) unaffected — full memory retrieval

================================================================================
2026-02-06 - Wake-Word-Only Gate (Stop Agent Loop on Bare "ava")
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- Added wake-word-only gate to _is_chat_only() in canonical runner
  - After stripping wake word + filler tokens (ha, um, uh, hey, hi, etc.),
    if fewer than MIN_CONTENT_WORDS (2) remain, returns short ack instead of None
  - Ack replies: "Yeah?", "I'm here.", "Go ahead.", "Listening.", "What's up?"
  - Logs: [wake-only] Wake word detected, no command content: '...' -> ack only
- Added MIN_CONTENT_WORDS = 2 class constant
- Gate runs BEFORE greeting patterns and command verb checks
- Commands with verbs still flow to agent loop: "ava open chrome" -> agent loop
- No /respond call, no memory retrieval, no tool execution for bare wake words

FILES MODIFIED:
- ava_standalone_realtime.py:
  - _is_chat_only(): wake-word-only gate at top, MIN_CONTENT_WORDS constant
- scripts/voice_smoke_test.py:
  - Added Test 7: Wake-word-only gate (12 checks)

WHAT TEST PROVED IT:
- Smoke test: 18/18 PASS
- Voice smoke test: 69/69 PASS (was 57, +12 new Test 7 checks)
  - Wake-only 'ava' -> ack (no agent loop) ✓
  - Wake-only 'ha ava' -> ack (no agent loop) ✓
  - Wake-only 'hey ava' -> ack (no agent loop) ✓
  - Wake-only 'hi ava' -> ack (no agent loop) ✓
  - Wake-only 'ava um' -> ack (no agent loop) ✓
  - Wake-only 'ava hello' -> ack (no agent loop) ✓
  - Command 'ava open chrome' -> agent loop ✓
  - Command 'ava search for news' -> agent loop ✓
  - Command 'ava type hello' -> agent loop ✓

ACCEPTANCE:
- Saying only "ava" (or "hey ava") never triggers agent loop
- Never says "completed tasks" for bare wake words
- Short ack returned locally (~instant, no server round-trip)

================================================================================
2026-02-06 - Turn-Scoped TTS Token (Voice-Only Response Gate)
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- Added turn-scoped TTS token to TurnStateMachine:
  - `_tts_token` field initialized to None
  - Token minted (uuid4 hex[:8]) on transition to DECIDE
  - Token cleared on force_idle()
  - `tts_token` property for thread-safe read
  - `mint_tts_token()` method for agent mode (no DECIDE transition)
- Gated `_speak_text()`: requires valid turn_id matching active token
- Gated `synthesize_speech()`: same turn_id gate for local TTS path
- Gated unified voice path: token check before `_voice_session.speak()`
- Updated `_maybe_handle_local_intent()` signature: added `turn_id=None`
- Threaded turn_id through ALL voice paths:
  - Standard ASR receiver (Deepgram)
  - LocalVoiceEngine hybrid path
  - LocalVoiceEngine legacy Whisper path
  - Unified voice session path
  - Agent mode ConversationText handler
- Converted startup degraded-mode announcement to log-only (no TTS — no active turn)
- Blocked TTS calls without valid token log: [tts.blocked_background]
- Added `import uuid` to runner

FILES MODIFIED:
- ava_standalone_realtime.py:
  - TurnStateMachine: _tts_token, tts_token property, mint_tts_token()
  - transition(): mint on DECIDE
  - force_idle(): clear token
  - _speak_text(): turn_id gate
  - synthesize_speech(): turn_id gate
  - _maybe_handle_local_intent(): turn_id param, all _speak_text calls threaded
  - ASR receiver: capture token after DECIDE, pass to _maybe_handle_local_intent + _speak_text
  - LocalVoiceEngine hybrid: same
  - LocalVoiceEngine legacy: same
  - Unified voice path: same + direct speak() gate
  - Agent mode: mint_tts_token on user text, pass to all handlers
  - Startup announcement: log-only, no TTS
- scripts/voice_smoke_test.py:
  - Added `uuid` to exec namespace for TurnStateMachine tests
  - Widened synthesize_speech chokepoint check window (500->800 chars)
  - Added Test 6: Turn-scoped TTS token (13 checks)

WHAT TEST PROVED IT:
- Smoke test: 18/18 PASS
- Voice smoke test: 57/57 PASS (was 44/44, +13 new Test 6 checks)
  - Signature checks: _speak_text, synthesize_speech, _maybe_handle_local_intent
  - mint_tts_token method exists, tts_token property exists
  - [tts.blocked_background] string in source
  - Static: ALL _speak_text calls have turn_id=
  - Static: ALL synthesize_speech calls have turn_id=
  - Logic: DECIDE mints token, force_idle clears it
  - Logic: mint_tts_token returns 8-char string
  - Logic: different turns produce different tokens
  - Startup announcement is log-only

WHAT'S NEXT:
- Ready for user direction on next work items

================================================================================
2026-02-06 - Whisper Stability Guard (Stop 20s Stalls / Empty Finals)
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- Raised min_audio_length 0.3s -> 0.8s in HybridASREngine (prevents tiny clips)
- Raised Whisper RMS threshold 0.005 -> 0.01 in 3 files (hybrid, standalone, provider)
- Added TTS/echo-gate guard to get_final_result(): skips Whisper during TTS playback
  and echo-gate grace period, discards accumulated echo audio
- Added same guard to legacy Whisper path (LocalVoiceEngine buffer_duration > 0.8s)
- Reduced Whisper timeout 5s -> 3s (prevents pipeline stalls)
- Removed 15+ DEBUG print lines from ava_hybrid_asr.py:
  - No more "[whisper-worker] Waiting for audio..." spam
  - No more "Raw result: ''" spam on empty results
  - Only non-empty results logged: "[whisper] Result: '...' (Xs, N segments)"
- Raised legacy buffer_duration threshold 0.5s -> 0.8s

FILES MODIFIED:
- ava_hybrid_asr.py:
  - min_audio_length: 0.3 -> 0.8
  - get_final_result(): tts_active/echo_gate_active params, RMS pre-check, 3s timeout
  - _transcribe_whisper(): RMS 0.005 -> 0.01, removed debug prints
  - _whisper_worker(): removed 6 debug prints
- ava_standalone_realtime.py:
  - Hybrid caller: passes tts_active + echo_gate_active, timeout 3s
  - Legacy path: buffer_duration 0.5 -> 0.8, TTS/echo guard
  - transcribe_audio(): RMS 0.005 -> 0.01
- voice/providers/whisper_provider.py: RMS 0.005 -> 0.01

WHAT TEST PROVED IT:
- Smoke test: 18/18 PASS
- Syntax check: all 3 modified files compile clean
- Guards verified: Whisper cannot run during SPEAK or echo-gate period
- Empty result spam eliminated: only non-empty results logged

================================================================================
2026-02-06 - Turn-State Hard Lock: Eliminate SPEAK->LISTEN Errors
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- Hardened TurnStateMachine: SPEAK state rejects ALL transitions via transition()
  - Uses [speak-lock] log instead of [VOICE_ERROR] — silently drops, not an error
  - Only force_idle() can exit SPEAK state (used by "TTS complete" path)
- Hard disabled barge-in: interrupt_speaking() always returns False
  - barge_in_enabled property always returns False
  - Setter ignores all attempts to enable
  - Hot-reload path ignores config barge_in.enabled value
- Set barge_in.enabled: false in ava_voice_config.json
- All VAD start events, Vosk/Whisper finals during TTS are silently dropped

FILES MODIFIED:
- ava_standalone_realtime.py:
  - TurnStateMachine: transition() hard lock, interrupt_speaking() disabled
  - Added is_speaking() helper
  - Hot-reload: barge-in always forced to False
- ava_voice_config.json: barge_in.enabled: false

WHAT TEST PROVED IT:
- Smoke test: 18/18 PASS
- Turn-state hard lock test: 11/11
  - SPEAK->LISTEN: silently dropped (no VOICE_ERROR)
  - SPEAK->FINAL: silently dropped
  - SPEAK->DECIDE: silently dropped
  - interrupt_speaking(): returns False
  - force_idle(): exits SPEAK to IDLE correctly
  - barge_in_enabled property: always False

BARGE-IN REINTRODUCTION:
- To re-enable barge-in later, remove hard locks in TurnStateMachine and
  hot-reload path. Gate behind a NEW feature flag with proven N-session stability.

================================================================================
2026-02-06 - Tool Policy Gate: Require Command Verb (+ Wake Word in Validation)
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- Added COMMAND_VERBS class constant (39 verbs) to StandaloneRealtimeAVA
- Added _has_command_verb() method: checks if transcript contains any command verb
- Added _should_allow_tools() policy gate:
  - Validation mode ON: requires wake word AND command verb
  - Validation mode OFF: requires command verb at minimum
- Gated 3 tool entry points:
  1. _try_tool_dispatch(): returns None if policy fails (no local tool dispatch)
  2. _ask_server_respond(): sends run_tools=False if policy fails (server chat only)
  3. handle_tool_call(): blocks tool execution if policy fails (last-resort gate)
- Refactored _is_chat_only() to use shared COMMAND_VERBS constant
- All gates log: [tool-gate] Blocked — no command verb...

FILES MODIFIED:
- ava_standalone_realtime.py:
  - Class constant COMMAND_VERBS (line ~1048)
  - _has_command_verb() and _should_allow_tools() (near _is_chat_only)
  - _try_tool_dispatch(): policy gate at entry
  - _ask_server_respond(): run_tools=tools_allowed (not hardcoded True)
  - handle_tool_call(): command verb check before Node boundary call

WHAT TEST PROVED IT:
- Smoke test: 18/18 PASS
- Tool policy gate test: 21/21
  - Validation ON: "hello a lot" blocked, "ava type hello" allowed
  - Validation OFF: "hello a lot" blocked, "type hello" allowed
  - Wake word only (no verb) blocked: "hey ava"
  - Command verb only (no wake) blocked in validation: "type hello"

================================================================================
2026-02-06 - Chat-First Routing (No Agent Loops for Greetings/Questions)
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- Added _is_chat_only() method to canonical runner (~line 5062)
  - Detects greetings, short questions, simple phrases without command verbs
  - Returns instant local reply string, or None to let agent handle it
  - Command verb whitelist: open/search/create/type/send/close/start/stop/run/
    delete/move/rename/copy/paste/click/find/show/play/record/capture/etc.
  - Only transcripts WITH a command verb go to agent loop
- Added chat-first gate at top of _maybe_handle_local_intent()
  - Runs BEFORE any server call in ALL voice paths (unified, local hybrid,
    local legacy, Vosk unified)
  - Logs: [chat-first] Direct reply (no agent loop): '...'
- Greetings respond locally (~instant), no server round-trip
- Time/date questions answered locally with datetime
- Wake word greetings handled: "hello ava", "hey eva", etc.

FILES MODIFIED:
- ava_standalone_realtime.py:
  - _is_chat_only(): new method
  - _maybe_handle_local_intent(): added chat-first gate at top

WHAT TEST PROVED IT:
- Smoke test: 18/18 PASS
- Chat-first routing test: 25/25
  - 13 chat phrases correctly handled locally (no agent loop)
  - 12 command phrases correctly sent to agent loop
- Acceptance: "hello", "hey ava", "what time is it" -> local reply, no agent loop

================================================================================
2026-02-06 - TTS Response Filter: Block Agent-Loop Status Messages
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- Expanded _is_step_status_message() with substring blacklist for all required phrases:
  "partially completed", "waiting for user input", "waiting_user", "idempotency",
  "tool execution", "agent loop", "max steps reached", "step limit", etc.
- Added regex patterns: "has been partially completed", "waiting for user/input"
- Moved filter into _speak_text() as a CHOKEPOINT — ALL voice paths now filtered:
  - Deepgram TTS path (_speak_text at line ~3300)
  - Local Edge TTS path (synthesize_speech at line ~580)
- Blocked messages logged: [tts-filter] Blocked agent-loop status: ...
- Normal conversational responses pass through unaffected

FILES MODIFIED:
- ava_standalone_realtime.py:
  - _is_step_status_message(): expanded with blocked_substrings list + new patterns
  - _speak_text(): added chokepoint filter before TTS
  - synthesize_speech(): added chokepoint filter before local TTS

WHAT TEST PROVED IT:
- Smoke test: 18/18 PASS
- Acceptance phrase test: 15/15 (11 blocked correctly, 4 normal responses pass)
- Blocked: "partially completed", "step X of Y", "waiting_user", "idempotency",
  "tool execution", "agent loop", "waiting for user input", "I am executing"
- Passed: greetings, weather, system info, tool confirmations

================================================================================
2026-02-06 - HARD DISABLE Full Autonomy in Voice Mode
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- Added DISABLE_AUTONOMY=1 env flag, set by voice runner at startup (line 206)
- Guarded moltbookScheduler.js: startMoltbookScheduler() exits early with log when flag set
- Guarded moltbook_heartbeat.py: run_heartbeat() exits early with log when flag set
- Updated start_ava_with_moltbook.bat: sets DISABLE_AUTONOMY=1 before any scripts
- Log lines when disabled: "[autonomy] disabled (voice mode)"
- No "Starting FULL AUTONOMY mode", no "Activity loop running", no "Checking post" in voice logs

FILES MODIFIED:
- ava_standalone_realtime.py (line 205-207: set DISABLE_AUTONOMY=1)
- ava-server/src/services/moltbookScheduler.js (lines 1002-1006: env guard)
- moltbook_heartbeat.py (lines 131-133: env guard)
- start_ava_with_moltbook.bat (added set DISABLE_AUTONOMY=1)

WHAT TEST PROVED IT:
- Smoke test: 18/18 PASS
- Python syntax check: all modified files compile clean
- Heartbeat test with DISABLE_AUTONOMY=1: returns {status: disabled_voice_mode}
- ProactiveManager + passive learning already gated by validation_mode (enabled in prior session)

WHAT'S NEXT:
- Ready for user direction on next work items

================================================================================
2026-02-05 - Audio Input & Validation Mode Fixes
================================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
- Fixed VALIDATION_MODE startup logging: now prints env + config values unconditionally
- Fixed audio input for WASAPI device 17: all 4 mic-open locations now use rate cascade
  (config rate -> 48000 -> 44100 -> 16000) with explicit logging, no silent fallback
- Added resampling: if mic opens at non-16kHz rate, audio is resampled via _resample_audio()
- Lowered Whisper RMS gate 0.01 -> 0.005 in 3 files
- Synced local governance files to match GitHub repo (were stale from initial setup)

FILES MODIFIED:
- ava_standalone_realtime.py (4 mic-open locations, RMS threshold, validation logging)
- ava_hybrid_asr.py (RMS threshold)
- voice/providers/whisper_provider.py (RMS threshold)
- agent/DECISIONS.md, ava_state.json, ava_feature_list.json, ava_progress.txt (synced)

WHAT TEST PROVED IT:
- Smoke test: 18/18 PASS
- Python syntax check: all 3 modified files compile clean

WHAT'S NEXT:
- All phases 1-4 complete (all features passes: true)
- Governance files synced to repo state
- Ready for user direction on next work items

================================================================================
